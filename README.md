# tripleA
tripleA is a blogging app made by me. This project is currently under development. To login as an admin, you must create a collection in the admin collections with name and password property because there's no certain way to create an admin account through the user interface.


## Running Guide
Run the command mentioned below to setup the project.
```console
npm i
```

After that, change .env.example to .env, and set the MONGO_URI and PORT to whatever mongodb uri or port you're going to use. 
```console
npm start
```
